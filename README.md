----------------

This library contains a database of MIME types that maps filename extensions
into MIME types suitable for use in many Internet protocols such as HTTP or
e-mail.  It is generated from the `mime.types` file found in Unix systems, but
has no dependency on a filesystem since it includes the contents of the
database as an ML datastructure.
